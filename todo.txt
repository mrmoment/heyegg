-> Masking (especially in post.php)


-------------------

* selection pop-up view
* selection comment function
* selection user-focus function*
* user credit function*
* add post view counts (design the method & rule first)

-------------------
* score mechanism

-------------------

* allow anonymous post submission?
* all masking effect for loading (load post/list/paging, login, logout, like, comment, score, submit, review)

----------------------------------
* Check all similar pages are with same frame ui and functions
* TEST logics that i can think... (remember the test script written down)
* TEST on the deployed environment...

----------------------------------
* check SQL injection (add keyword judgement for input parameters)
* data & code backup mechanism
